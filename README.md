Empowering Seamless Business Payments in Emerging Markets
TradeFlow B2B is a decentralized B2B payment platform built on Celo and optimized for MiniPay. It streamlines stablecoin-based transactions between merchants, wholesalers, and retailers, especially in emerging markets where access to traditional banking is limited.

The platform enables users to send and receive payments using Mento stablecoins (like cUSD, cEUR etc.), automatically generates digital receipts, and stores transaction metadata on-chain for efficient retrieval. It utilizes MiniPay’s Pockets for smooth currency swaps, leverages Mento's broker contract for on-chain exchanges, and integrates with MiniPay’s on/off-ramp rails to facilitate fiat ↔ crypto conversions.

TradeFlow B2B makes mobile-first business payments fast, transparent, and reliable — all within the familiar MiniPay experience.
